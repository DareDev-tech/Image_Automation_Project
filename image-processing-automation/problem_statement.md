## Project Problem Statement: Image Processing Automation

As part of this project, I address a real-world image processing challenge using Python.

The scenario involves a company preparing for a website relaunch. A batch of icon graphics was delivered by a design contractor, but the assets arrived in the wrong format, were rotated 90 degrees, and were too large for web use. With the contractor unreachable and a deadline approaching, a quick and automated solution was needed.

This project demonstrates how Python and the Pillow library can be used to automate the following tasks:

- Iterating through a folder of image files  
- Rotating each image to the correct orientation  
- Resizing them to the required dimensions  
- Converting the file format (e.g., from `.tiff` to `.jpeg`)  
- Saving the images in a specific format in a separate directory  

This solution is a practical example of how automation can be applied in IT and DevOps workflows to save time and reduce manual errors when handling repetitive file processing tasks.
