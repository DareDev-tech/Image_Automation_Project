# Python project 1: Image Processing Automation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project solves a real-world image processing challenge using **Python** and the **Pillow** library.

The scenario:  
A company preparing for a website relaunch received a batch of icon graphics from a design contractor. Unfortunately:  
- The images were in the wrong format  
- They were rotated 90Â°  
- They were too large for web use  

With the contractor unavailable and a tight deadline looming, a quick automated solution was needed.

This script automates the entire processâ€”turning hours of manual work into a matter of seconds.

## Features
- **Batch Processing:** Iterates through all images in the input folder
- **Rotation Fix:** Rotates each image to the correct orientation
- **Resizing:** Scales images to the required web dimensions
- **Format Conversion:** Converts files (e.g., `.tiff` â†’ `.jpeg`)
- **Organized Output:** Saves processed images in a separate directory

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Library:** [Pillow (PIL Fork)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)

## ðŸ”„ How It Works
1. **Scan Input Folder** â€“ The script reads all image files inside `images/`.  
2. **Rotate** â€“ Corrects orientation by rotating each image to its proper position.  
3. **Resize** â€“ Adjusts images to the required dimensions for web optimization.  
4. **Convert Format** â€“ Changes image format (e.g., `.tiff` â†’ `.jpeg`) for compatibility.  
5. **Save Output** â€“ Stores processed images into `processed_images/` with the correct naming and format.  


## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases
- Preparing images for websites or mobile apps  
- Automating repetitive image formatting tasks in forensics, image editing devopsamong others.  
- Bulk image correction for digital marketing or CMS uploads.
